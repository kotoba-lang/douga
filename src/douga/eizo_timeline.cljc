(ns douga.eizo-timeline
  "kami.eizo.timeline (the canonical eizo/video-domain EDL, ADR-2607121400
  Wave 1) -> douga.ffmpeg's render-plan shape. This is douga's Wave-4
  rewire onto kami-eizo-timeline as its canonical input IR: the legacy
  loose scene/lines/assets shape consumed by `douga.ffmpeg/build-render-plan`
  remains available (the live yukkuri production pipeline, ADR-2607051600,
  depends on it and is not touched here) — this namespace is a second,
  parallel entry point for callers that already build a real
  `kami.eizo.timeline` value.

  Mapping (see this repo's README for the full contract):
    - one :video track, one clip per scene: :clip/source-id is the frame
      blob key, :douga/scene-index orders scenes.
    - one :audio track, one clip per voice line: :clip/source-id is the
      voice blob key, :douga/scene-index + :douga/line-index order lines
      within/across scenes, :douga/text + :douga/speaker carry caption data.
    - bgm is a single timeline marker named \"bgm\" carrying
      :douga/bgm-blob-key.
    - fps comes from the timeline's timebase (rounded, since ffmpeg -r takes
      an integer frame rate here — see kami.eizo.timeline.timecode/frame-rate-round).
    - resolution isn't part of kami-eizo-timeline's EDL model, so it's read
      from an extra :douga/resolution key on the timeline map itself
      (defaults to \"1280x720\", same default douga.ffmpeg/build-render-plan
      already used).

  v0 scope: video-track transitions (dissolve/wipe/etc.) are not supported —
  douga's ffmpeg command builders only ever produce hard cuts (concat -c
  copy). A video track carrying a transition is rejected with ex-info rather
  than silently ignored; wiring dissolve/wipe to a real xfade filter_complex
  is a follow-up, not this rewire."
