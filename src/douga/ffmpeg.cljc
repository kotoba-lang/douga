  kami.eizo.timeline's overlap semantics (kami.eizo.timeline/validate-transition:
  clip B's :clip/timeline-start = clip A's clip-end - transition duration,
  i.e. the two clips overlap by exactly the transition's duration) map
  directly onto ffmpeg xfade's own offset/duration semantics: offset (the
  point in stream 0 where the transition begins) = duration-a - transition
  duration; duration = transition duration. Total output duration =
  duration-a + duration-b - transition duration — the same
  overlap-consumes-shared-frames arithmetic kami.eizo.timeline already
  uses, so a plan built from an already-validated EDL never needs to
  re-derive it. This offset/duration arithmetic is identical for
  :dissolve and :wipe — only the xfade `transition=` mode differs.

  `transition=fade` (:dissolve) is a genuine linear alpha crossfade, not a
  hard cut or a fade-to-black: verified empirically (see
  test/e2e/real_dissolve_proof.cljs and this repo's README) — a red->blue
  dissolve samples ~50/50 R/B channel contribution at the transition's 50%
  point, and the blend shifts monotonically across the transition window.
  `transition=wipeleft` (:wipe) is a genuine moving spatial boundary, not a
  blend: verified empirically (see test/e2e/real_wipe_proof.cljs and this
  repo's README) — at a fixed timestamp mid-transition, sampling pixels
  across the frame's width shows clip A's solid color on the (still
  unrevealed) right portion and clip B's solid color on the (already
  revealed) left portion, with a sharp boundary between them (not a
  gradient), and that boundary's x-position moves leftward as the
  transition progresses through 25%/50%/75%."

(defn xfade-chain-cmd
  "N-clip chained-transition render — the generalization of
  xfade-transition-cmd for a video track with TWO OR MORE sequential
  transitions bridging THREE OR MORE clips in a row (e.g. clip1 --T1-->
  clip2 --T2--> clip3 --T3--> clip4 ...), into ONE continuous output video
  via a single ffmpeg invocation with N-1 chained `xfade` filter_complex
  stages. xfade-transition-cmd itself only ever builds a 2-input, 1-stage
  graph — it has no notion of chaining, and looping it per-pair would not
  produce a correct chained graph (see the offset arithmetic below), which
  is why this is a separate function rather than a wrapper around it.

  THE CHAINING GOTCHA this function exists to get right: ffmpeg's `xfade`
  `offset` is relative to the START of its own first input stream. For
  stage 1 that first input is clip 1 itself, so offset_1 is the same
  `from-duration - transition-duration` arithmetic as xfade-transition-cmd.
  But stage 2's first input is NOT clip 2 or clip 1 alone — it is stage 1's
  OUTPUT stream, whose duration is already `duration(clip1) + duration(clip2)
  - duration(T1)` (clip 1's and clip 2's combined, overlap-consumed length).
  A naive per-pair loop that reused each clip's own raw duration for every
  stage's offset would therefore get every stage after the first WRONG.
  The correct offset is computed against the chain's CUMULATIVE output
  duration so far, matching kami.eizo.timeline's own chained-overlap
  `timeline-duration` arithmetic exactly (validate-transition's overlap
  invariant applied transitively down the chain, not just pairwise):

    D_0 = duration(clip_0)
    D_k = D_(k-1) + duration(clip_k) - duration(transition_k)   (k = 1..n-1)
    offset_k = D_(k-1) - duration(transition_k)                 (stage k, 1-indexed)

  Each stage k's filter_complex clause therefore chains onto the PREVIOUS
  stage's output label, not a raw source label: stage 1 is
  `[v0][v1]xfade=...:offset=offset_1[vx1]`, stage 2 is
  `[vx1][v2]xfade=...:offset=offset_2[vx2]` (or `[v]` if it's the final
  stage), and so on — never `[v1][v2]xfade=...` for stage 2, which would
  silently discard the accumulated overlap from stage 1.

  segments: ordered vector of N maps `{:frame-blob-key :duration-frames}`,
  one per clip, in timeline order — the same shape
  `douga.eizo-timeline/render-plan`'s `:segments` already carries.
  transitions: ordered vector of exactly (count segments)-1 maps
  `{:duration-frames :transition-type}`; transitions[k] (0-indexed) bridges
  segments[k] and segments[k+1] — the same adjacency
  `douga.eizo-timeline/render-plan`'s `:video-transitions` already carries
  for a video track with sequential transitions (sort by
  `:from-scene-index` first if a track's transitions weren't authored in
  timeline order). `:transition-type` defaults to `:dissolve` per entry,
  same as xfade-transition-cmd; unknown types throw ex-info up front
  (before any ffmpeg argv is built), same fail-loud discipline.
  opts: :width :height :fps — same as xfade-transition-cmd.

  Total output duration = sum of every clip's own duration minus the sum
  of every transition's duration (each transition consumes exactly its own
  duration of shared overlap, once, chain-wide — never double-consumed
  even when two transitions both touch the same middle clip)."
