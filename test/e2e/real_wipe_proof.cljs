  "Real-ffmpeg-subprocess proof that douga's :wipe transition render path
  (`douga.eizo-timeline/render-plan`'s :video-transitions +
  `douga.ffmpeg/xfade-transition-cmd` with `:transition-type :wipe`)
  produces a genuine moving spatial boundary -- not a temporal blend like
  :dissolve, not a hard cut, not a silently-ignored transition, not a
  broken/corrupted filter.

  This is the :wipe counterpart to test/e2e/real_dissolve_proof.cljs: same
  overall pattern (lavfi-generated solid-color stills, a real
  `kami.eizo.timeline` EDL, the REAL douga code paths, a real ffmpeg child
  process, real ffprobe, real pixel sampling) but a DIFFERENT verification
  strategy, because a wipe is spatial, not a temporal blend: instead of
  sampling ONE fixed pixel across MULTIPLE timestamps (dissolve's
  strategy -- proving a color blend shifting over time at a fixed point),
  this proof samples MULTIPLE x-positions across the frame's width at a
  SINGLE fixed timestamp mid-transition (proving a spatial boundary between
  two solid-color regions at one instant), and repeats that at three
  different timestamps (25%/50%/75% through the transition window) to
  prove the boundary's x-position genuinely moves over time.

  Builds a 2-clip `kami.eizo.timeline` EDL -- a 4s red clip and a 4s blue
  clip -- bridged by a 2s :wipe transition (same overlap semantics as the
  dissolve proof: the blue clip's timeline-start is 2s *before* the red
  clip's end, i.e. they overlap by exactly the transition's duration;
  total EDL duration is 4+4-2=6s, not 4+4=8s). Drives that EDL through the
  REAL `douga.eizo-timeline/render-plan` (which no longer rejects :wipe --
  see this repo's README) to get :video-transitions (now carrying
  :transition-type :wipe), then the REAL `douga.ffmpeg/xfade-transition-cmd`
  (with :transition-type :wipe, selecting xfade's `wipeleft` mode) to get
  the actual ffmpeg argv, executes it with a real `ffmpeg` child process,
  and verifies with `ffprobe` + pixel sampling that:
    - total duration matches the overlap-adjusted 6.0s (not 8.0s -- proving
      douga honors kami.eizo.timeline's overlap semantics for :wipe too,
      not just :dissolve);
    - at each of 25%/50%/75% through the transition window, sampling pixels
      at x=10/30/50/70/90% of the frame width (fixed y=center) shows a
      SHARP two-region boundary (clip A's red on the still-unrevealed
      right portion, clip B's blue on the already-revealed left portion --
      `wipeleft` sweeps the reveal edge right-to-left as the transition
      progresses) -- NOT a smooth per-pixel blend the way :dissolve's fixed
      spatial point shows a shifting color mix over time;
    - the boundary's x-position genuinely moves left as progress advances
      from 25% -> 50% -> 75% (more of the frame is blue at 75% than at 25%
      at every sampled x-position once revealed, and the count of
      blue-classified samples strictly increases 25% -> 50% -> 75%).

  Requires: system `ffmpeg` + `ffprobe` on PATH, and a local checkout of
  kotoba-lang/kami-eizo-timeline whose src/ is reachable via classpath. Run
  from the douga repo root:

    nbb -cp src:<path-to-kami-eizo-timeline>/src test/e2e/real_wipe_proof.cljs

  Exits 0 and prints a PASS report on success, exits 1 with the failing
  assertion(s) printed on failure. Never fabricates a pass: every check
  below is a real measurement of a real file produced by a real ffmpeg
