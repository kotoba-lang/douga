  "Real-ffmpeg-subprocess proof that douga's render path can CHAIN two
  transitions across three clips in a single video track, as ONE ffmpeg
  invocation -- the multi-transition gap this repo's README explicitly
  flagged as unwired after the single-transition :dissolve/:wipe proofs
  (test/e2e/real_dissolve_proof.cljs, test/e2e/real_wipe_proof.cljs): both
  of those only ever exercise ONE transition between exactly TWO clips.

  This proof exercises `douga.ffmpeg/xfade-chain-cmd` (new in this change)
  driven by the REAL `douga.eizo-timeline/render-plan` output for a 3-clip
  EDL with 2 transitions: a real `kami.eizo.timeline` chain of
    clip A (red, 4.0s) --[T1 :dissolve, 1.5s]--> clip B (lime, 4.0s)
                        --[T2 :wipe, 1.5s]--> clip C (blue, 4.0s)
  (kami.eizo.timeline overlap semantics, transitively applied down the
  chain: clip B starts 1.5s before clip A's end, clip C starts 1.5s before
  clip B's end -- total EDL duration = 4+4+4-1.5-1.5 = 9.0s).

  The crux this proof is designed to catch: ffmpeg xfade's `offset` for a
  CHAINED stage is relative to the START of its own first input stream --
  and stage 2's first input is stage 1's OUTPUT (duration
  4.0+4.0-1.5=6.5s), not clip B's own raw 4.0s duration. A command builder
  that got this wrong (reused clip B's own duration for stage 2's offset
  arithmetic instead of the chain's accumulated duration) would produce a
  stage-2 offset of 4.0-1.5=2.5s instead of the correct 6.5-1.5=5.0s --
  placing the wipe transition inside stage 1's dissolve blend window
  instead of after it. This proof's final-output timeline layout is chosen
  specifically to make that class of bug visible via pixel sampling, not
  just via offset-string inspection:

    [0.0, 2.5)  pure red             (before T1)
    [2.5, 4.0)  T1 :dissolve blend   (red -> lime, 1.5s)
    [4.0, 5.0)  pure lime            (steady region BETWEEN T1 and T2 --
                                       only exists if stage 2's offset is
                                       correctly computed against the
                                       chain's accumulated duration, not
                                       clip B's own raw duration)
    [5.0, 6.5)  T2 :wipe sweep       (lime -> blue, 1.5s)
    [6.5, 9.0)  pure blue            (after T2)

  Reuses both existing proofs' verification techniques within one render:
  dissolve's fixed-position/multi-timestamp temporal-blend sampling for
  T1, wipe's multi-x-position/fixed-timestamp spatial-boundary sampling
  for T2, plus a genuine pure-color sample in the steady gap between them
  (checkpoint (c) below) -- proving BOTH transitions render correctly
  TOGETHER in a single ffmpeg invocation, not just each in isolation.

  Requires: system `ffmpeg` + `ffprobe` on PATH, and a local checkout of
  kotoba-lang/kami-eizo-timeline whose src/ is reachable via classpath. Run
  from the douga repo root:

    nbb -cp src:<path-to-kami-eizo-timeline>/src test/e2e/real_chained_transitions_proof.cljs

  Exits 0 and prints a PASS report on success, exits 1 with the failing
  assertion(s) printed on failure. Never fabricates a pass: every check
  below is a real measurement of a real file produced by a real ffmpeg
  subprocess."
